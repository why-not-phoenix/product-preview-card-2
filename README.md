## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

This wasn't a particularly difficult challenge, although for whatever reason it took to more time than I expected to complete. Was my first time really diving deep into Bootstrap and I often found myself doing some things myself rather than using Bootstrap. I had to look up some pages for responsiveness and chatgpt was my friend when I had things seemingly not work well. Some it helped with while others I had to figure out myself.
I guess what took the most time was trying to perfect the dimensions, which I still don't think I got right. I think going forward, I'd not bother too much on making my dimensions exactly as in the design but instead focus more on getting the design in itself right. Hopefully my OCD allows this.
All things considered, I guess I am improving everyday.
If you've read this far then, wel thanks for indulging me.
